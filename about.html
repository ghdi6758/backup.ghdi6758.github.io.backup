## About


<p> I am a data scientist working in the area of journalism, politics, health, and computational social science. I am also interested in opinion mining from text. The research I do is highly interdisciplinary, which only can be achieved by combining theoretical foundations, computational methods such as NLP and machine learning, and massive computing capability. </p>


<p> <small> Before moving to QCRI in May 2014, I received my PhD in Computer Science from a Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge. My Ph.D. dissertation was on news sharing in social media, in particular, I have focused on media influence and its political bias which are known to bring negative individual and societal effects. For my study, I was an honorable recipient of Google European Scholarship in Social Computing. In addition, I have been fortunate to have opportunities to collaborate with pioneers in the field of social media analysis (e.g., MPI-SWS (Germany), KAIST (South Korea), PARC (USA), and Yahoo! Barcelona (Spain)). Before joining Cambridge, Jisun completed BS and MS in Computer Science and Engineering with a concentration in Social Computing at Korea Advanced Institutes of Science and Technology (KAIST) in 2007 and 2009, respectively.
